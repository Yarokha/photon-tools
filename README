photon-tools - Tools for analysis of single-photon measurement data


photon-tools are a set of tools for manipulating and analysing data from
single-photon, particularly FRET and FCS, experiments.


Work-flow:
==========
These tools are meant to examine input data of 64-bit unsigned integer
timestamps.

For example, a simple FCS analysis of data from the Goldner group's FPGA
timetagger might consist of,

1) Collect data
2) Extract timestamps from data stream with extract_timestamps
3) Bin data
4) Generate autocorrelation function using autocorr
5) Fit curves to data using fcs-fit


Tools:
======

  == General ==

  dump_pt2: Output Picoharp PT2 records in human-readable format
  extract_pt2_timestamps: Export timestamps from Picoharp PT2 file
  plot-photons: Plot binned photon time series
  rm-times: Crop out a region of timestamps
  splice-times: Splice together a set of timestamp files

  == FCS ==

  fcs-fit: A simple-minded tool for fitting models to FCS correlation functions

  == FRET ==

  fret_hmm: Hidden Markov Model analysis of FRET trajectory
  wavelet_denoise: Wavelet denoising


Data formats:
=============

  == Picoharp PT2 ==

This package includes utilities for exporting timestamps from Picoharp's PT2
file format. See picoharp documentation for details on this format.

  == Timestamps ==

Timestamp data is represented by 64-bit integer timestamps, one file per
channel.

  == Binned data ==

Photon bin data consists of 12 byte records in the following format,
	bytes 7:0	Integer start time of bin
	bytes 8:11	Number of photons in bin

  == Correlation function ==

A correlation function is represented by 16 byte records of the following
format,
	bytes 7:0	Integer lag
	bytes 8:15	Double-precision floating point function value
