fcs-tools - Tools for analysis of single-photon measurement data

These are a set of tools for manipulating and analysing data from single-photon
experiments. 


Work-flow:
==========
The following assumes that the data is being collected with the UMass FPGA
timetagger.

1) Collect data
2) Bin the data using bin_photons
3) Convert binned data into stripped format with strip_bins
4) Generate autocorrelation function using autocorr
5) Fit curves to data using fcs-fit

Data formats:
=============

Stripped bin format:
autocorr expects data in "stripped bin" format, consisting of 12 byte records
in the following format,
	bytes 7:0	Bin start time
	bytes 8:11	Number of photons in bin

Autocorrelation function format:
autocorr produces its autocorrelation function in the following format,
	bytes 7:0	Lag
	bytes 8:15	Double-precision value
